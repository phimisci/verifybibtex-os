VerifyBibTeX-OS documentation
=============================

VerifyBibTeX-OS is a Python application that checks your BibTeX file for potential errors. It outputs the results in the command line and writes them to a file called `verifybibtex-report.md`. The checks are particularly focusing on information necessary for valid citations in the APA style. For an overview of the checks, see the :doc:`Docs <source/modules>`. The application heavily relies on the Python package `bibtexparser <https://bibtexparser.readthedocs.io/en/main/index.html>`_.
